# R-for-Political-Data-Science
Scripts and data used in the book "R for Political Data Science: A Practical Guide" by Francisco Urdinez and Andres Cruz

These scripts are intended to accompany a legally purchased copy of "R for Political Data Science: A Practical Guide" by Francisco Urdinez and Andres Cruz. 
Only the written code is included and not the text of the chapter, so these scripts wonâ€™t make much sense without the book accompanying.
Because these scripts are limited to the written code in the chapters, no code is included for the exercises.
Scripts were tested with R 4.0.3 and R Studio 1.3.1093
